## NEEDS OWNER VERIFICATION

### AboutPage
- Brand Story "installing as a 16-year-old kid" — is this accurate?
- Milestone years: 2020 for SBE Certified — correct year?
- Yolanda Lara: "30+ years of industry experience" — still accurate?
- Josue Gonzalez: "28 years in commercial glazing" — still accurate?
- "several highly trained, scalable installation teams" — accurate description?

### ResidentialPage
- Pricing estimates (Shower $1,500-$3,500, Mirrors $15-$25/sqft, etc.) — are these current?
- Testimonials J.K. and V.S. — verified real reviews?
- Should more residential projects be added when available?

### CaseStudyPage
- Cabrillo Business Park narrative (challenge, solution, phases, durations) — embellished by AI, needs fact-check
- Should more real case studies be added?

### TestimonialsPage
- Testimonials on this page look potentially real (T.Y. mentions Northridge, Mike Cook from Smith and Severson, Fulcrum Construction is a real GC)
- Client list and supplier list — are these current and accurate?
- Decision needed: keep page (re-link in nav) or remove route?

### ContactPage
- FAQ mentions "San Francisco Bay Area" — is this still accurate for service area?
- Business hours "Mon-Fri: 7:00 AM - 4:00 PM" — still current?
